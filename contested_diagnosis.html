        <!-- Causes of Burnout Being a Contested Diagnosis: -->
        <details>
            <summary>Variability in Definitions</summary>
            <p>There is no single, universally accepted definition of burnout, leading to ambiguity and variability in understanding what constitutes burnout.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Complexity of Measurement</summary>
            <p>The psychometric instruments used to measure burnout, like the MBI, vary and may not capture the full scope of the condition, affecting the consistency of diagnosis across different contexts.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Overlap with Other Conditions</summary>
            <p>Burnout shares symptoms with other mental disorders like depression and chronic fatigue, making it difficult to differentiate and diagnose accurately.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Diverse Manifestations Across Professions</summary>
            <p>Burnout is observed differently across various professional domains, suggesting that its causes and symptoms may be context-specific, which complicates the establishment of a clear diagnosis.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Lack of Systematic Consideration of Social Factors</summary>
            <p>While personal and organizational factors are often studied, the broader social and societal context of burnout is not systematically accounted for, indicating a gap in understanding the full range of its causes.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Physiological Correlates Are Not Conclusive</summary>
            <p>Attempts to identify biological markers for burnout are ongoing, but without a clear physiological signature, the diagnosis remains primarily behaviorally based.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Hindrance to Effective Intervention Development</summary>
            <p>Ambiguity in what burnout entails can lead to the creation of interventions that may not be adequately tailored to address its specific aspects or may ignore critical contributing factors.</p>
